# Surfs_Up Analysis
 
## Overview:

The purpose of this analyssis is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable over the course of a year. This is done by analysing temps for June and December.

## Results:

The findings indicate the following:

- June has an average temperature of 75
- The majority of the temperature datapoints (50%+) are above 70
- December has a slightly lower average of 71
- Even with the lower average the majority of the temperatures (50%+) are above 70

Here you can see both months side by side:

## Summary:

With this data it is clear the stores would be viable. The temperatures remain relatively high most of the time. There are some additional queries that could be run. They are:

- Query for precipitation. Rain can limit ice cream and surf sales
- Querying for the mode may also be useful as that will indicate the temperatures that appear most in the two months
